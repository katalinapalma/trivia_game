## Trivia Game
An online trivia game using Vue.js framework. 

## Project structure
The project consists of three pages, Start, Question and Result. 

Start page, is where the user can set the game settings. The user can choose a category, difficulty and the numer of questions to answer. When the user clicks on the Start button, the user gets re-directed to the Question page.

The question page displays one question at a time. When the user has answered a question and clicks on the Next button, a new question appears. When all questions are answered the user can click on a Show result button to get re-directed to the Result page.

The result page shows the user's score, all questions the user answered along with the correct answer and answer the user chose. The user also has the option to replay the game with the same category and difficulty settings but with different questions or to go back to the Start page.
